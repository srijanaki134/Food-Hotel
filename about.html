    <!--Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair,
    and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies
    need to function. The energy in food is measured in units called calories



       in this case, a person cooks and offers meals or kits via their website, which are then directly sent to
    consumers.[5] The consumer chooses which meal and how many meals they want sent to their office or home, and pays
    depending on the meals or the program they are interested in. People choose to order meals from other people for
    different reasons: not wanting or having time to cook, wanting to eat home-cooked meals, or to lose weight by eating
    healthy foods. Examples of this type of service include DineWise, NutriSystem, Chef's Diet, etc.[5]-->
